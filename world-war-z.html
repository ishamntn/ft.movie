      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p>In World War Z, former United Nations investigator Gerry Lane is thrust into a global crisis when a fast-moving zombie pandemic threatens to devastate humanity. After witnessing the chaos unfold in his own city, Gerry is tasked with finding the source of the outbreak and a possible cure. Traveling across the world, from South Korea to Israel, he uncovers critical information about the virus, including the zombie's strange behavior and how to avoid being infected. With the fate of mankind on the line, Gerry races against time to find a solution, navigating through dangerous environments and close calls with the undead. The film highlights themes of survival, the fragility of society, and the global response to a worldwide disaster. Ultimately, Gerry discovers a potential way to stop the spread, but only through a risky and uncertain plan.</p>
