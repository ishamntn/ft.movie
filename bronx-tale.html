      <h2>Synopsis</h2>
      <p> A Bronx Tale tells the story of Calogero "C" Anello, a young boy caught between the influences of his working-class father, Lorenzo, and the charismatic, dangerous mob boss, Sonny. After witnessing a murder, Calogero forms a secret bond with Sonny, who takes him under his wing, teaching him about loyalty, respect, and the harsh realities of life. As Calogero grows up, he faces choices that challenge his beliefs, including his friendship with a girl from a different race. Torn between his father's values and Sonnyâ€™s influence, Calogero learns that the choices he makes will define his future. The film explores themes of family, morality, and the search for identity in a divided community. Ultimately, Calogero learns the importance of making his own path and understanding the true cost of the decisions he faces.</p>
